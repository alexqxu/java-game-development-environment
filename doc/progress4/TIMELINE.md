#### Event 1 - Displaying entities from the backend in GameView (4/7)

- Involved all members
- Received a collection of Entity objects from the data controller, created imageview for each entity, and then 
added to the scene in its designated location

#### Event 2 - Incorporating Registration / Login Screen (4/15)

- Franklin and Ryan worked on the implementation of the Registration/LogIn screen.
- The main form of communication between Ryan and Franklin was direct as they pair-coded that part of the assignment.
- After Franklin and Ryan were done with the implementation they did well to make a post in Group Chat as well as make 
a merge request with a good title and description so that the rest of the team knew what was going on.
- Also, Franklin and Ryan asked the rest of the team to create accounts and report any bugs encountered.

#### Event 3 - Redesign Game Engine (4/15)

- Worked on by Alex, Abebe, Vineet, and Achilles (Back end team)
- The Game Engine was redesigned to be composed of three main components, the Trigger Handler, the Action Applicator, 
and Physics Calculator. Each of these components work in tandem to perform the task delegated to the Game Engine: to 
determine what needs to be done to entities in the Game, and perform those actions on the entities. 
Please see Design.md or the video demo for more information on this design change.
- Solved the issue of object’s not having “memory” of their action performed by implementing a Physics Engine that 
employed Newtonian mechanics
- Did not affect implementation in the front end so was later described to the other members but other code was 
not changed


#### Event 4 - Including Level Editor (4/17)

- Ryan and Franklin worked on the implementation of the level editor
- Once implemented, told people working on the back end about the feature and how it could be used for testing their 
collisions. 
- Informed us when we need to include writing the background image in the xml file


#### Event 5 - Finishing Collisions (4/23)
- Backend finally implemented all the collisions that possibly could occur
- Informed the front end people that it was finished but did not affect their code since bindings were used for the 
entity objects’ movements
