# Team Contract

1. We will attend all group meetings
2. We will respond to messages in our group chat within a day’s time.
3. We will use Git only to store and edit our code.
4. We will not edit each others’ classes, methods, enums, and other files without express permission from the file owner.
5. During code reviews / pull requests, at least one member must approve of code design before merging with production branches.
6. Always ensure that branches are up to date before merging with master, to avoid losing work - merge requests must be used. 
7. When meeting in Zoom or any other group meeting platform, we will always
enable screen sharing for all breakout rooms before commencing the meeting
discussion itself if that functionality is supported by the meeting platform.
